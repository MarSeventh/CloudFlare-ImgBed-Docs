# API Overview

CloudFlare ImgBed provides a series of API interfaces that facilitate users and developers to perform file upload, deletion, listing, and random image retrieval operations.

## API Endpoints
- **Upload API**: `/upload`
- **Delete API**: `/api/manage/delete`
- **List API**: `/api/manage/list`
- **Random Image API**: `/random`

## Authentication

For all interfaces that require authentication, unless otherwise specified, the API Token authentication method is uniformly adopted. Users need to provide a valid API Token during upload to perform related operations.

### API Token Generation

Users can generate API Tokens in the CloudFlare ImgBed `Admin Panel -> System Settings -> Security Settings -> API Token Management`. After generation, please save it properly, as for security reasons, the Token will only be displayed once.

::: warning Notice
Try to set Token permissions according to the required operations, and avoid using overly broad permissions.

Do not leak API Tokens to others to avoid unnecessary security risks.
:::

### API Token Usage

When calling the API, you need to add the following field to the request header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
or
Authorization: YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

Usage example:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-cloudflare-imgbed-url/upload" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
-F "file=@/path/to/your/image.jpg"
```
